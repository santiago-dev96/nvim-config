# nvim-config

This repository has my Neovim configuration files.

## Setup

Clone the repository, the repository is what you would normally have in `$HOME/.config/nvim`, you decide how to do it, but usually you have two options:

1. Clone the repository directly in `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
2. Clone the repository anywhere you want, and then create a symlink to `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
